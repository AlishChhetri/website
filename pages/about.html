        <div class="base-section">
            <h3>Education & Experience</h3>
            <p>Currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Software Engineering at Allegheny College, I've complemented my academic education with practical experience in various roles:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>As a Post Processing Intern at Acutec Precision Aerospace, I developed software that automated packaging configurations for over 12,000 SKUs, saving approximately 1,000 hours annually.</li>
                <li>At Allegheny College's Computer and Information Science Department, I developed Chasten, a Python-based static analysis tool that uses XPath expressions to detect AST patterns.</li>
                <li>As an IT Technician at Allegheny College, I've provided support for over 1,000 students and conducted a comprehensive network audit to ensure secure and reliable connectivity.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I'm also involved in leadership roles as the Secretary of ACM Allegheny College Student Chapter, where I co-founded the chapter and organized the college's first-ever hackathon. Additionally, I serve as a Teaching Assistant in the Computer and Information Science Department, mentoring 40+ students and enhancing their programming skills.</p>
