            <h1>The Performance of Authenticity: BeReal and Digital Identity</h1>
            <h2>Analysis of Snyder (2023)</h2>
        </div>

        <div class="base-section">
            <h3>Personal Notes</h3>
            <p>This paper explores BeReal's promise of authenticity and how the platform's rules, like posting on time and limiting retakes, shape user behavior. Instead of reducing pressure to perform, BeReal creates a different kind of performance where users strive to appear both spontaneous and interesting. The platform's concept of being "real" feels less about authenticity and more about meeting an ideal of curated imperfection.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="base-section">
            <h3>Most Interesting Ideas</h3>
            <p>I found the discussion about BeReal's focus on "timeliness" particularly compelling. The platform claims to encourage authenticity by limiting user control, but its demand for immediate, on-time posting actually amplifies the pressure to perform. The idea that authenticity is tied to being both real and interesting creates a tension that mirrors broader social media trends.</p>
            
            <p>The "memories" page also stood out, as it shows how even moments meant to feel unfiltered are turned into curated archives. This transformation of spontaneous moments into a personal collection reveals how BeReal, despite its claims, ultimately functions as another form of digital self-presentation.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="base-section">
            <h3>Confusing Aspects</h3>
            <p>The methodology described in the paper felt confusing, especially the "qualitative walkthrough" approach. The process seemed subjective, relying heavily on the researcher's interpretation of the app's design and user discourse. It blurred the line between personal opinion and data collection, making it difficult to see how the findings were grounded in broader, replicable research methods.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="base-section">
            <h3>Connections to Other Experiences</h3>
            <h4>Classroom and Everyday Life</h4>
            <p>The paper's discussion of the performative nature of social media reminded me of moments when I've seen friends or classmates scramble to set up the "perfect" BeReal post. Even though the app is meant to capture genuine, unfiltered moments, the act of responding to its notifications often feels like a performance in itself.</p>
            
            <p>While I haven't personally used the platform, I've observed others rushing to stage their surroundings or adjust their appearance, which seems to contradict the app's intent. I imagine classmates who actively use BeReal could share similar experiences or perhaps even challenge this perspective.</p>
            
            <h4>Co-Curricular Activities</h4>
            <p>BeReal's personal and ephemeral focus doesn't translate well to organizational use. Unlike platforms like Instagram or Facebook, it isn't designed for broad outreach or promotional purposes. As a result, I haven't seen it used in campus events or activities. Instead, personal Polaroids or photo booths often take its place as tools to capture shared moments in a more tangible, private way. This difference highlights how BeReal's emphasis on individual experiences limits its utility in collective settings.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="base-section">
            <h3>Critical Analysis</h3>
            <p>BeReal's approach to authenticity raises important questions about the nature of digital identity and self-presentation. While the platform attempts to break away from the highly curated nature of apps like Instagram, it inadvertently creates its own form of performanceâ€”one that values spontaneity and "realness" but still operates within a framework of social validation and digital archiving.</p>
            
            <p>The tension between BeReal's stated goals and actual user behavior reflects a broader paradox in digital culture: our simultaneous desire for authentic connection and carefully managed self-presentation. This contradiction suggests that true digital authenticity may be impossible within platforms that inherently encourage performance and social comparison, regardless of how they frame their approach to content creation.</p>
