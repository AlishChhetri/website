            <h1>Beyond Representation: Queerness in Video Games</h1>
            <h2>Analysis of Ruberg (2019)</h2>
        </div>

        <div class="base-section">
            <h3>Personal Notes</h3>
            <p>This paper argues that queerness in video games extends beyond visible LGBTQ representation, suggesting that queerness can be found in gameplay, mechanics, and player engagement. Ruberg challenges the idea that queer representation in games is a recent phenomenon, emphasizing that queerness has always been part of gaming, even if it hasn't always been recognized. The paper explores how queer players reshape games through their own perspectives, and how game design itself can reflect queer ways of being and resisting dominant norms.</p>

            <h3>Most Interesting Ideas</h3>
            <p>The idea that queerness in games isn't just about who is represented on-screen but how players interact with the game world is really compelling. This suggests that queerness can be embedded in how a game is played—whether through bending the rules, reinterpreting narratives, or playing in unintended ways. The discussion about "playing queer" also stood out to me, especially the idea that failing, resisting, or subverting gameplay can be a form of queer expression.</p>
            
            <p>This perspective shifts the focus from simply counting LGBTQ characters to examining how gaming spaces can embody queer experiences through their mechanics, design choices, and the ways players engage with them. It suggests that queerness has always been present in gaming, even when explicit representation was absent, through these alternative ways of playing and experiencing games.</p>

        <div class="base-section">
            <h3>Confusing Aspects</h3>
            <p>Some of the theoretical frameworks, particularly the connection between queer theory and game mechanics, felt a bit dense. The argument that queerness can exist in the procedural elements of a game—things like mechanics and player agency—was interesting but sometimes hard to grasp. I also found it challenging to follow how the paper distinguishes between queer readings of games and actually queer game design. The overlap between player interpretation and developer intent wasn't always clear to me.</p>

            <h3>Connections to Other Experiences</h3>
            <h4>Classroom Connections</h4>
            <p>The discussion about how queerness in games goes beyond representation made me think about how people interact with other media forms in unexpected ways. In class discussions about representation in film and television, we talked about how audiences find meaning even when it's not explicitly there. This idea of "reading queerness into" games reminded me of how fans of shows or movies often create their own interpretations that challenge mainstream readings.</p>
            
            <p>In everyday life, I've noticed that some games, even ones without obvious LGBTQ content, create spaces where players explore identity in ways that feel deeply personal and subversive.</p>
            
            <h4>League of Legends Example</h4>
            <p>The example of League of Legends stood out to me since it's a game I regularly play with friends. The complexities of global censorship laws shape how League of Legends is experienced across different regions. In China, depictions of skeletons and the undead are discouraged, prompting developers to modify character designs to align with cultural sensitivities. However, these censorship laws can also require developers to adjust or remove representations of queerness to comply with local regulations.</p>
            
            <p>This highlights how players around the world experience the same game differently based on cultural and political contexts, which often restrict how queerness can be expressed and perceived within gaming spaces.</p>

            <h3>Everyday Life</h3>
            <p>The paper's discussion about how queerness in games goes beyond representation made me think about how people interact with other media forms in unexpected ways. In class discussions about representation in film and television, we've often talked about how audiences find meaning even when it's not explicitly there. This idea of "reading queerness into" games reminded me of how fans of shows or movies often create their own interpretations that challenge mainstream readings.</p>
            
            <p>In everyday life, I've noticed that some games, even ones without obvious LGBTQ content, create spaces where players explore identity in ways that feel deeply personal and subversive. We also briefly discussed the rise of movements like #GamerGate and how the alt-right has leveraged the anonymity and reach of the internet to push back against diversity and inclusivity in gaming. In that context, Ruberg's argument felt like a refreshing counterpoint.</p>

            <h3>Co-Curricular Activities</h3>
            <p>I have not seen much direct engagement with queer game studies in extracurricular activities, but student organizations on campus provide opportunities to explore these ideas. For example, a friend from high school, who presented as feminine at the time, often chose to play male characters in our Dungeons & Dragons campaigns within a supportive friend group.</p>
            
            <p>Over the course of a few years, they became comfortable enough to come out as trans, and it has been inspiring to see how much more at ease they are in their identity now. This experience aligns with ideas about queer agency in games and how they can serve as spaces for self-exploration and expression.</p>
